# Projects Utilizing C#
C# using Visual Studio is probably the best environment for **Rapid Development.**

## Programmatic Program Generation / Duplication
Sometimes known as 4GL or forth generation programming languages, C# is a powerful tool for generation of repetitive or performance dependant C# code.
This [*Open Source*](https://github.com/90301/TextReplace) application providies users the ability to process files,
 generate ANY template code in ANY programming language and quickly duplicate and replace components.
 
 Here's a simple example of some code generated:
```C#
/*
This file was generated by the Cyberia Pre-Processor
Language of output file: C#
File Generated on: 11/15/2018 5:29:03 PM

*/
/*
foreach varlist blockstart
GetGroup1Q1
GetGroup1QAddressMatch
GetGroup1QOwnerOfficer
GetGroup1QLiabilityCheck
GetGroup1QBadAddress
GetGroup1QDisposableEmail
GetGroup1QDuplicateEmail
GetGroup2QBadAddress
GetGroup3QContributionsCheck

foreach content blockstart
GetGroup1Q1 = "GetGroup1Q1"
foreach content blockend
foreach varlist blockend
*/
GetGroup1QAddressMatch = "GetGroup1QAddressMatch"
GetGroup1QOwnerOfficer = "GetGroup1QOwnerOfficer"
GetGroup1QLiabilityCheck = "GetGroup1QLiabilityCheck"
GetGroup1QBadAddress = "GetGroup1QBadAddress"
GetGroup1QDisposableEmail = "GetGroup1QDisposableEmail"
GetGroup1QDuplicateEmail = "GetGroup1QDuplicateEmail"
GetGroup2QBadAddress = "GetGroup2QBadAddress"
GetGroup3QContributionsCheck = "GetGroup3QContributionsCheck"
```

## Electronic Data Exchange Utilities (EDI-Utilities)
Mapping client information to a near dark factory environment can be a difficult task with electronic orders coming in a number of formats each proprietary to an individual vendor.

EDI Mapping takes vendor data and works to standardize it. That's great when you know the format, but what happens when you don't know the format? Manually sifting through IDOC / Text / Binary / CSV / XML / Flat Files is for suckers.

Introducing the EDI Utilities Application. [Open Source](https://github.com/90301/EDI-Utils) and custom developed for DAK Americas, this utility can take a known conversion and make mappings, or unknown data and attempt to determine what data is held where.

### [Java](https://github.com/90301/MarkdownResume/blob/master/Technologies/Java.md)
Java shares nearly the exact same design / development paradigms. Stream processing has the same performance and functionality, just with different method names.

To demonstrate that, here's some example code calculating the total sales made in a given year between the two languages.
```C#
//C#
List<Sales> list = new List<>();
//...
Double totalSales = list.stream()
.Select(x -> x.getSalePrice())
.Aggregate((x,y) -> x + y);

```

```Java
//Java
List<Sales> list = new ArrayList<>();
//...
Double totalSales = list.stream()
.map(x -> x.getSalePrice())
.reduce((x,y) -> x + y).orElse(0.0);
```

Both of these examples do the exact same thing, the two languages even share the same syntax.

## Why IIS?
It's the default, and works well for most organizations. Most Microsoft centric organizations prefer to stay in the Microsoft ecosystem.
