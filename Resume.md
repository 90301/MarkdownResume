# Research Interests
## Energy Efficient Computing
<img src="http://bluechipai.net/images/CompleteBluechip_Crop.png" width="756">
Making the worlds most efficent computers allows us to perform more calculations per dollar. Current computers use about half of their energy on cooling. Thanks to the Cyberia Rack design (pictured above), we've reducing cooling costs to less then 1% of the total enegy used (A 98% reduction in energy used).

## Artificial Intelligence
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/90301/PersonalWeb/master/images/NavybattleUI2_4.png" width="750" >
Artificial Intelligence at it's core is about creating a system that creates systems. Ideal use cases include playing securities markets, drug discovery, and self replicating and repairing robotics. Sometimes the best solution is to build something that creates the best solution.

## Robotics / Automation
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/90301/PersonalWeb/master/images/RoboArm.png" >
Robotics brings automation to the physical world. A dark factory is a manufacturing facility that has no human workers in it, allowing it to operate considerably more efficently. You don't have to run air conditioning / lights allowing dark factories to be some of the most efficent buildings. Not only can robotics vastly improve profitibility through lower defect rates and 24/7 production, but many processes that were not feasable with human labor become attainable. There's almost no limit on expansion potential. For example: greater sample sizes for processes like drug testing. The combination of robotics and AI allow for discovery at paces unrivaled before.

## Microbiology / Chemistry

[CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) is a genetic engineering technique that allows us to alter DNA in a cost effective way. When combined with AI for prototyping and Robotics for large scale testing, it may be possible to create new drugs / organisms that sevrve particular purposes.
