# Technical Interests
## Energy Efficient Computing

Making the worlds most efficent computers allows us to perform more calculations per dollar. Current computers use about half of their energy on cooling. Thanks to the Cyberia Rack design (pictured above), we've reducing cooling costs to less then 1% of the total enegy used (A 98% reduction in energy used).

## Artificial Intelligence
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/90301/PersonalWeb/master/images/NavybattleUI2_4.png" width="750" >
Artificial Intelligence at it's core is about creating a system that creates systems. Sometimes the best solution is to build something that creates the best solution.

## Code Generation
Some programming is inhertinly repetitive. Writting tools / scripts to reduce that burden can prove quite helpful. Typical usecases include "upgrades" or migrations.
