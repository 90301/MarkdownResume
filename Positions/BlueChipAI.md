# Blue Chip AI
As president of Blue Chip AI, I wear a number of *hats*. Primarily I deal directly with Investor relations.


 A large part of my role includes development of **all** of our internal and external facing systems and technologies. 
 I was responsible for creating the MVP (minimum viable product) of the AI 
 and proving it's efficacy for solving exceptionally complex and contradictory problems. 


 Following that, I manage the long term vision of the company, along with the other members of the team.
